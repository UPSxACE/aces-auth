# Ace's Auth
[![version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/upsxace/aces-auth?label=version)](https://github.com/upsxace/aces-auth/releases)

A lightweight identity and access platform for modern web and backend applications — inspired by Auth0, Okta, and Clerk.

> 🔐 Plug-and-play OAuth sign-in, roles, and permissions for your app — with first-class SDKs for Next.js and Spring Boot.

Standards-based authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect — without the boilerplate. Register your app, drop in the SDK, and go.

## 🚧 Status
This project is currently under active development. While the core functionality is in place, the platform and SDKs are evolving rapidly. Expect improvements, new features, and refinements over time.

> 📚 The README will be expanded soon with full documentation, usage examples, and integration guides.
